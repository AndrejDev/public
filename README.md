# Task
Write some (Java) code that translates a string (word, sentence, or paragraph) into “pig-latin” using the following rules.

               * Words that start with a consonant have their first letter moved to the end of the word and the letters “ay” added to the end.

                              * Example: Hello becomes Ellohay

 

               * Words that start with a vowel have the letters “way” added to the end.

                              * Example: apple becomes appleway

              

               * Words that end in “way” are not modified.

                              * Example: stairway stays as stairway

              

               * Punctuation must remain in the same relative place from the end of the word.

                              * Example: can’t becomes antca’y

                              * Example: end. becomes endway.

              

               * Hyphens are treated as two words

                              * Example: this-thing becomes histay-hingtay

              

               * Capitalization must remain in the same place.

                              * Example: Beach becomes Eachbay

                              * Example: McCloud becomes CcLoudmay
